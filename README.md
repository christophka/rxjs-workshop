# RxJS Workshop

This is an interactive workshop to demonstrate the usage and ideas behind [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/).

Hopefully I can find some time to make this more intuitive and add some more puzzles.

## Project

This workshop project uses Angular as an UI framework. Even though RxJS isn't framework specific, it is tightly integrated in Angular and is used here is scaffolding.

After you cloned the repo, run

```
npm i
```

To start the development server run

```
npm start
```
